# Steganography.
- Steganography as an information security method hides data or a message within another file, non-elusive file thus masking the evidence of the hidden information. 
- Steganography, by contrast, is concerned with hiding the message itself and the mere existence of the message from anyone, including the one who possesses the message and in such cases, encryption is not necessary. 
- It can also be employed in text, images, or videos.
- In this project, we'll concentrate on a text-based steganography. The secret is hidden within the text itself by continuously editing the text in a text document by inserting spaces or tabs in a certain pattern.
